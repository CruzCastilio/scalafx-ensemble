Scalafx Ensemble
================

ScalaFX Ensemble show cases various controls that have been implemented in scalaFX. Each control
displays a running example and code. We believe ScalaFX ensemble could help beginners or adopters 
of scalaFX to get inspired to start building apps. This project itself is inspired from 
JavaFX-ensemble. 

If you are also a Scala enthusiast you are most welcome to contribute to this project by 

Identifying the controls which are in ScalaFX and not showcased in ScalaFX Ensemble

Create a working example of the said control which in turn could be added here
