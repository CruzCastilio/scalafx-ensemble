Instead this project is developed in [ScalaFX](http://code.google.com/p/scalafx/). We know that it looks slightly different from the JavaFx Ensemble we are working towards it thus making it as better as possible !!!! \r\n\r\n### Update \r\nWe are done with the most of the controls in the ScalaFx (including charts,grapics2d). However all these are bleeding edge releases as we are looking forward for the first level of launch of ScalaFx API. On case to case basis we jump-in to fix any issues in the API itself. Again stay tuned .... \r\n\r\n![latest screenshot](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10783650/Screen%20Shot%202012-12-25%20at%208.19.56%20AM.png)\r\n\r\n### Update \r\nWe made some more progress on creating more examples here is the latest screenshot.
